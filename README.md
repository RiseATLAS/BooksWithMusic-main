## 🧠 AI Mood Detection

The app analyzes chapter text and detects **10 mood types**:

| Mood | Icon | Music Style |
|------|------|-------------|
| Dark | 🌑 | Atmospheric, suspenseful, dramatic |
| Mysterious | 🔍 | Ethereal, ambient, enigmatic |
| Romantic | ❤️ | Emotional, piano, tender |
| Sad | 😢 | Melancholic, slow, emotional |
| Epic | ⚔️ | Orchestral, cinematic, powerful |
| Peaceful | ☮️ | Calm, ambient, serene |
| Tense | ⚡ | Suspenseful, tense, dramatic |
| Joyful | 😊 | Uplifting, cheerful, happy |
| Adventure | 🏝️ | Energetic, cinematic, dynamic |
| Magical | ✨ | Fantasy, mystical, ethereal |

**How it works:**
1. Scans chapter text for mood indicators (keywords, emotional language)
2. Assigns energy level (1-5) and tempo (slow/moderate/upbeat)
3. Maps mood to music tags (e.g., "dark" → "atmospheric", "tense")
4. Selects best-matching tracks from music library
5. Updates music as you navigate between chapters
